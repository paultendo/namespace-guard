# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve `namespace-guard`.

## Before You Start

- Open an issue before starting non-trivial work.
- Keep core zero-dependency: do not add runtime dependencies to the core package.
- Profanity list updates should follow the existing curation/source process (see `docs/data/profanity-words.SOURCE.md`), not raw bulk dumps.
- Adapter contributions are welcome; follow the existing patterns in `src/adapters/`.

## Pull Request Flow

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`.
2. Implement your change with focused scope.
3. Run `npm test` and `npm run typecheck`.
4. Open a PR against `main` with a short summary of what changed and why.
